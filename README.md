# The Factors that Affect The Happiness of Population

## Overview

This project explores and analyzes the key factors influencing the happiness of populations around the world. Using data-driven methodologies, it aims to uncover trends, correlations, and insights that help understand what contributes most to happiness across different countries and cultures.

## Features

- Data collection and preprocessing
- Statistical analysis and visualization of happiness-related metrics
- Exploration of social, economic, and environmental factors
- Interactive charts and graphs for deeper insights
- Reproducible analysis with clear documentation

### Tools and Statistical Methods Used in R

- **Data Manipulation and Cleaning:**  
  Utilized packages such as `dplyr`, `tidyr`, and `readr` for efficient data wrangling and preprocessing.
- **Statistical Analysis:**  
  - Descriptive statistics (mean, median, standard deviation, etc.)
  - Correlation analysis to identify relationships between variables
  - Regression analysis (linear regression) to quantify the effect of different factors on happiness
  - Hypothesis testing
- **Data Visualization:**  
  Employed `ggplot2` and other visualization libraries for:
    - Histograms and boxplots
    - Scatter plots and regression lines
    - Bar charts and comparative graphs
- **Reporting and Reproducibility:**  
  - Used R Markdown (`rmarkdown`) for dynamic reporting and reproducibility.
  - Generated well-documented notebooks for step-by-step analysis.

## Data Sources

The project leverages data from:
- World Happiness Report
- World Bank Open Data
- United Nations Development Programme (UNDP)
- Other open-source datasets relevant to population well-being

Contributions are welcome! Please submit pull requests or open issues if you have suggestions, bug reports, or would like to contribute to the analysis.

## Conclusion

This project highlights that happiness is a multifaceted phenomenon influenced by various factors such as GDP per capita, social support, healthy life expectancy, freedom to make life choices, generosity, and perceptions of corruption. The findings suggest that while economic prosperity contributes to happiness, social and psychological factors play an equally important role. Policymakers and stakeholders aiming to improve population well-being should adopt a holistic approach that addresses both material and non-material aspects of life.
